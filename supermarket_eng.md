# Project information
The analysis is based on supermarket sales data from a three-month period (Januaryâ€“March) in 2019. The supermarket has branches in three different cities. The goal of this analysis is to identify key sales trends, customer preferences, and evaluate differences in the popularity of product categories depending on location.

#### Questions this analysis aims to answer:
- What is the distribution of customers by gender and city
- What factors influence customer satisfaction levels
- Which product lines are the most and least popular in different cities
- Is there a relationship between the price of a product and the quantity in which it is purchased
- Which cities and product categories generate the highest profit
- During which hours do stores experience the highest customer traffic

- customer satisfaction with purchases (Rating) is independent of the other analyzed factors (customers base their ratings on different aspects)
- the quantity of purchased products (Quantity) is not related to their unit price (Unit price)
- the strong correlation between tax (Tax 5%), cost of goods sold (COGS), revenue (Total), and gross income (Gross income) aligns with expected financial relationships

# Dashboard
![png](dashboard_1.png)

## Key information
The dashboard presents revenue and cost of sales for each day of the month, with filtering options for month and city. It includes a summary table by product line and a chart displaying aggregated revenue on an hourly scale.
- total revenue: $322.97K
- total cost of sales: $307.59K
- total gross profit: $15.38K
  
## Trend analysis
- on days such as the 4th, 13th, 18th, and 22nd of each month, there are declines in revenue. On the other hand, revenue increases are observed on 7th-9th and 15th. Declines and increases in revenue alternate throughout the month
- the most profitable city is Naypyitaw, where the gross profit amounted to $5.27K. Naypyitaw's highest earnings come from the Food and Beverages category (about $1.1K) and Fashion Accessories (around $1K)
- in other cities, the gross profit is $5.06K
- low revenues are observed in the afternoon hours (3:30 PM - 6:30 PM), while the highest earnings occur in the evening (7:00 PM - 7:30 PM), suggesting that customers tend to do more shopping after work.
- the highest gross profit was recorded in January ($5.54K), while the lowest was in February ($4.63K)
  
![png](dashboard_2.png)

- the highest revenues were recorded on Saturdays ($56K in total), followed by Tuesdays ($51K)
- mondays have the lowest revenues ($38K), which could be due to fewer customers after weekend shopping
- sales on weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and Sundays remain at a stable level of around $44K

## Sales analysis by product line
- the differences between revenues across various categories are minor, with the highest earnings coming from Food and Beverages ($56.1K)
- the lowest gross profit is recorded in Health and Beauty ($2.3K) due to low sales, while other categories generate around $2.5K-$2.6K, suggesting stable sales across those lines
  
## Recommendations
- #### increase the number of customers during times or days with lower traffic
  - introduce promotions during times when sales are lower to boost customer activity
  - implement a loyalty program where customers earn points for every purchase, which can later be exchanged for rewards
- #### encourage more frequent purchases from less profitable categories (especially Health and Beauty)
  - expand the product offering by introducing new, popular products to attract more customers
  - run targeted marketing campaigns on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This could include sending products to influencers with high visibility
  - offer personalized promotions (sent via SMS) for customers who have an account in the store, making the offers more attractive
  - regularly update the store layout and display posters to capture the attention of customers
- #### invest in profitable product lines in cities with the highest performance to maintain and increase customer interest
  - expand the range of products â€” for example, if customers are interested in Fashion Accessories in Naypyitaw, consider introducing more expensive and luxurious products in that category
  - increase warehouse capacity to avoid stockouts of popular items and create space for new products (as mentioned in the previous point)
  - organize local events and collaborate with influencers. This could include hosting themed events, workshops at supermarkets, or inviting influencers to be brand ambassadors to further engage customers and raise brand awareness
